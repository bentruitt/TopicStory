Setting up a Virtual Environment
--------------------------------

First, install python, pip, and virtualenv (if already installed, skip this step).
$ sudo apt-get install python
$ sudo apt-get install pip
$ sudo pip install virtualenv

Second, create a local virtual environment.
$ virtualenv venv (or some other name)

Third, activate the virtual environment.
$ source venv/bin/activate
(to deactivate the virtual environment)
$ deactivate

Fourth, create a requirements.txt file with the required dependencies (if already present, skip this step).
$ vim requirements.txt
    flask=0.11.1
    gunicorn=19.6.0
    etc.

Fifth, install the requirements (make sure the virtaul environment is currently activated).
$ pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
(the upgrade is required to get the most recent version of pillow, otherwise it throws IOError's)

Sixth, download spacy corpus:
$ python -m spacy.en.download all
