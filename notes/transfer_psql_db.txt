To transfer PSQL data, for example from AWS to a local machine, there's two steps.
First, dump the DB to a file:
$ pg_dump news > news.db
Second, scp the file over:
$ scp NewsApp:/home/ubuntu/news.db ./news.db
Second part 2 (optional), clean the news database
$ psql
scott=# drop database news;
scott=# create database news;
scott=# \q
Third, restore the file:
$ psql -d news -f news.db -U scott
Fourth, delete the news.db files:
$ rm news.db (local)
$ rm news.db (on AWS)
