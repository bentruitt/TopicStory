Installing Dependencies With Low Amounts of RAM
-----------------------------------------------

When running `pip install` on the DO droplet, sometimes packages won't compile because of memory.
The main error message is:

  error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 4

This can be alleviated by adding swap space, and removing it when finished.
To add swap space, run the following commands.
  $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288
  $ sudo mkswap /swapfile1
  $ sudo chown root:root /swapfile1
  $ sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile1
  $ sudo swapon /swapfile1

Now that there is extra program memory available, the pip install should work.
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the dependencies are installed, the swap space can be removed.
  $ sudo swapoff -v /swapfile1
  $ sudo rm /swapfile1


Another common memory error (from Python) is:
  
  MemoryError

To fix this error, simply use the --no-cache-dir argument.

  $ pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
