## Topic Modeling

Topic modeling refers to a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms which look for patterns in text data.
The idea is to group similar articles together which form "topics".
For example, when running topic modeling on news articles, one topic might be related to sports, another to the election, another to the Syrian refugee crisis, and so on.
