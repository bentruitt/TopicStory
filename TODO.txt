Major Goals
-----------
- All: Reorganize database queries
    --> Return dictionaries instead of objects
    --> Have either a single models.py file or models/ module which is accessed by all three subprojects (add stuff as needed)
            --> put off for now (not sure how much more organized this would make the codebase)
    --> Would be useful for simplifying queries, allowing for dynamic changes, less overhead, etc.
- Analysis: Topic Modeling
    --> Load a week's worth of data into the corpus
    --> Find major topics for that week
    --> Tell how much each article corresponds to that topic
    --> (optional) allow for custom dates
- Analysis: Clustering
    --> Cluster a week's worth of data
    --> (optional) allow for customizing cluster size
    --> (optional) allow for custom dates
    --> would be useful for looking for major stories/groups of stories reported on multiple outlets
- Website: Display Topic Modeling
    --> Not sure how to do this yet
- Website: Display Clustering
    --> Not sure how to do this yet
- All: Write a test suite
