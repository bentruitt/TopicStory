Major Goals
-----------
- All: Reorganize database queries
    --> Return dictionaries instead of objects
    --> Would be useful for simplifying queries, allowing for dynamic changes, less overhead, etc.
- Crawler: Track sources
    --> Add another (sources) table
    --> Source name, Source base URL, id
    --> Referenced in visits table (uses source, not base url)
    --> would be useful for displaying recent articles
- Website: display recent articles
    --> Main page would have overview of count for last week for each source
    --> Click a source to see all articles from last week, sorted by date
    --> (optional) allow for custom dates
    --> would be useful for getting a high-level overview of crawler, check running ok
- Analysis: Topic Modeling
    --> Load a week's worth of data into the corpus
    --> Find major topics for that week
    --> Tell how much each article corresponds to that topic
    --> (optional) allow for custom dates
- Analysis: Clustering
    --> Cluster a week's worth of data
    --> (optional) allow for customizing cluster size
    --> (optional) allow for custom dates
    --> would be useful for looking for major stories/groups of stories reported on multiple outlets
- Website: Display Topic Modeling
    --> Not sure how to do this yet
- Website: Display Clustering
    --> Not sure how to do this yet
- All: Write a test suite
